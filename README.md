# Personal Photo Portfolio

🌐 Live site: http://twilightfrosty.com/

A personal portfolio built as a **static front-end application**, combining my work as a **full-stack engineer** and a **photographer**.

This site is designed not only to showcase photographs, but also to reflect how I think about **systems, interaction, performance, and visual storytelling**.

---

## About

I’m a full-stack engineer with a strong focus on front-end architecture, UI systems, accessibility, and performance — and a photographer who cares deeply about structure, rhythm, and narrative in images.

This portfolio sits at the intersection of those two practices:
- Photography as content
- Engineering as the medium

---

## Features

- Responsive photo portfolio with masonry layout
- Full-screen image viewer with adaptive layout logic for horizontal and vertical photos
- i18n (multi-language support)
- Light / dark / system theme
- Subtle motion and background effects with respect for reduced-motion preferences
- Static, CDN-friendly asset loading

---

## Tech Stack

- **Vite**
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- CSS (custom design system, no UI framework)

This is a **pure front-end static site** — no backend, no database — suitable for deployment on GitHub Pages or any static hosting platform.

---

## Philosophy

- Minimal UI, strong structure
- Avoid unnecessary cropping of images
- Let content define layout, not the other way around
- Treat performance and accessibility as first-class concerns

---

## Deployment

Deployed as a static site via GitHub Pages.
